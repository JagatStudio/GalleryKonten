Its distinctive feature lies in the precise text generation within images, addressing a challenge not easily tackled by similar tools like Midjourney or DALL-E.</p><p>While currently in the development phase, Ideogram allows users to incorporate typography within images, ensuring that the generated visuals accurately reflect the inputted text without spelling errors. The showcased poster, created on Ideogram AI, serves as evidence of the tool's efficacy in delivering on its typography claims—a unique accomplishment compared to other AI image generators.</p><p>Similar to DALL-E, Ideogram AI boasts accessibility through a user-friendly web interface, eliminating the need for reliance on third-party platforms like Discord to kickstart your creative journey. The platform also provides a range of presets to customize the medium of generated images, coupled with options to select an aspect ratio.</p><p>However, there are resolution limitations for downloaded images. The maximum resolution, achievable with the default aspect ratio (1:1), is 1024×1024 pixels. Other aspect ratios result in reduced image resolution, generating images at 1024×640 pixels in landscape mode and 640×1024 pixels in portrait mode.</p><p>Presently, Ideogram AI allows users to create an unlimited number of images, with the flexibility to view and manage their creations within their Ideogram AI profile. It's important to note that this feature may evolve as the tool progresses out of beta and gains more user traction in the future.</p>"
